# Week 1 Challenge

### My take on the Challenge
- Divided up each section in the HTML.
- The first section in the body I named header as well as added nav for the first two nav spots since it is in the top of the website and the three sections on the top right navigate you through the page.
- Changed Div in <div> class="hero" </div> to img since it is for the main image in the HTML.
- Added main right after img signifying that we are now on the main portion of the website.
- Added sections to split up each of the secondadry images and information.
- I then added aside because this would be for the side bar information as well as added their respected sections.
- Then finally ended the html with footer.
- Then went to CSS and minimized each section that had similar attributes that by added them together and splitting them up by commas.
- Tested the final product and realized that nothing had changed and the website was the same as I originally started with.
